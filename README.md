lorem is a command line tool that outputs lorem ipsum text, i just thought it was convenient to have a terminal tool for that and thought i'd make one, funny thing is that this tool can print 435 times 10 to the power of 1000 characters and it will store them in ram to do so,there's no computer that can handle that 

usage : 
	Lorem -[c|l|p|h] *count*
	
	examples :
	
	Lorem -- outputs 1 paragraph of text, equivalent to Lorem -p or Lorem -p 1
	Lorem -c 300 -- outputs 300 characters
	Lorem -l outputs one line
	Lorem -h outputs this help message
